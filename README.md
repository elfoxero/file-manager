# File Manager

File Manager is an app for Firefox OS to explore and manage files from SD card.

**Requirements**

This app requires permissions to access to SD card.

**Features**

- Allows to copy, move, rename and delete files.
- Allows to create, rename and delete folders.
- Opens any file as music, video, text or image.
- Opens PDF files (requires Firefox OS 1.4 or greater).
- Allows to set as wallpaper any image.
- Allows to share any file via bluetooth, email and more.
- Allows to create and edit text plain files.
- Allows to manage any folder making long press on it.

**For developers: integrate your app with File Manager** (requires File Manager 1.0-beta2)

If you have created an app that interacts with some files in SD card, File Manager can use your app to open these files directly.

You just need to add an activity to your manifest file, specifying the file type that your app supports. For example if you want to create a simple SVG image viewer:


```js
{
	"activities": {
		"open": {
			"filters": {
				"type": ["image/svg+xml"]
			},
			"disposition": "inline",
			"returnValue": true,
			"href": "/index.html"
		}
	}
}
```

File Manager will send to your app the following data:

```js
{
	"type": "image/svg+xml",
	"filename": "/sdcard/image.svg", // For example
	"blob": [object Blob],
	"allowSave": false
}
```

Currently, the app supports the following file types:
